                        There is no rational justification for homework. Children spend far more hours at school than is good for them...and the
                        idea that they have to do large amounts of work at home IN ADDITION, merely...(shows) that much of
                        the time that they spend at school is being wasted.

                    <p>The word “Exam” is the nightmare of the lives for most of the students. They bring a lot of stress, anxiety,
