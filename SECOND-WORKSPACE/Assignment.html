                        Samvida is a unique experiment in enabling learning for children. The primary stakeholders in this community are the children
                        and their parents. Parents at Samvida are not consumers of a service, but are partners in the endeavour.
                        Hence, we are keen on building lasting parent partnerships. By this, we mean parents who by choice
                        want to provide an alternate learning environment for their and will play an active role in the operations
                        and teaching learning processes. In fact, several learning facilitators at Samvida are parents. A
                        parent can choose any area to make significant contribution.

                            Currently, we are welcoming partnerships from parents whose children are between ages 6 and 12. The Samvida community will
                            be delighted to have on board enthusiastic experts, from all fields. We welcome participation
                            by passionate people from different areas, so that our children have the opportunity to interact
                            and grow with their support.
